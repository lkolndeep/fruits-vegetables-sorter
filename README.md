# fruits-vegetables-sorter
It is a sorter which divides in two different lists fruits and vegetables.

# Installation
Once you clone the project, the application will be available on this URL: `path/to/index.html` 

# How does it function?
You will find an interface with a textfield. You must enter a fruit or a vegetable among the following two lists and click on `Validate` each time:
* fruits: banana, apple, cherry, coconut, mango
* vegetables: tomato, capsicum, courgette, sweet potato, peach

Once you finish your addings, you can click on `Sort all elements` and you will find two separated lists. And you must refresh your page if you want to use sort again with a new list.
